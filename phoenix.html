													<h3>Rings of Peach</h3>
												</header>
												<p>My favorite freeze dried candy is the mouth watering freeze dried peach rings: Rings of Peach. Not only do they expand to 300% their normal size, but these mega rings taste like a nostalgic, sweet, crunchy heaven. After achieving a big goal of mine, I love to relax with a bag of these crunchy delights. I would highly recommend them to anyone with a sweet tooth.</p>

													<h3>Caramel Crunchies</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Another favorite of mine (and my lovely girlfriend) are the freeze dried caramel M&Ms: Caramel Crunchies. While transforming the caramel center to a fluffy cloud-like texture, the shell of the M&M splits in two, maintaining the sweet crunch and soft chocolate. These are my personal favorite to eat while relaxing with a movie - and they also make fantastic gifts for any occasion.

													<h3>Phoenix Bemiller</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Hi! My name is Phoenix and I am the proud founder of the company, Sweet Yo' Self™. I was born and raised in Eugene, Oregon and am a dedicated student at the University of Oregon. I take pride in my business and being able to continue growing even while working part time, going to school, and having a wonderful relationship with my girlfriend. Although life can get really busy at times, I always remind myself that it is short, and I need to make opportunities to Sweet My' Self! Here's my story about how this business came to be - I hope you enjoy learning a bit more about me!</p>
												<p>I began the Sweet Yo' Self journey during my senior year of high school when I was only 17 years old. During the preceding years to my discovery of freeze dried candy, I had grown to adopt an extremely strict diet. I aspired to become a fitness influencer and had entirely cut sugar out from my diet. After doing this for over a year and recording my progress online, I realized that it didn't matter how hard I was working because I wasn't achieving my true goal: to enjoy life, and be happy. I took a break from social media and began allowing myself to enjoy life a bit more. While still maintaining a healthy balance, I allowed myself to indulge in some sweets every now and again. My company's name acts as a reminder to everyone that no matter where you are in life, you should always treat yourself with kindness, and every now and again, Sweet Yo' Self!</p>
												<p>The first time I tried a freeze dried candy I was immediately intrigued and delighted by the crunchy, yet, familiar taste. It wasn't long before I self-funded my very own small freeze dried candy business. Although I thoroughly enjoy every aspect of running this company, the best feeling comes from seeing the surprised, delighted faces of my customers as they sweet themselves with my home crafted products. Knowing that I am providing the highest quality of sweets for people motivates me to continue expanding the company and making people's lives a little bit sweeter.</p>

								<p><strong>Finleigh Hamilton:</strong> My lovely girlfriend, who has been my biggest support throughout the creation and maintenance of this company. Whether it was helping me with deliveries, running tables with me at local markets, or keeping me motivated throughout the hardest times, I have always been able to rely on her. She continues to help me every day, and I wouldn't be where I am today without her. </p>
								<p><strong>Giani Alvez:</strong> My best friend and the official web developer of the official Sweet Yo’ Self™ website has also supported me throughout the whole process. Even while living over 3000 miles away, not only has Giani helped me create the very website you see before you, but he has also helped me strategize and expand the company.</p>
